            <strong>Personal Background: </strong>I’m a married father with 2
            kids that are now teenagers. We moved to Charlotte from Ohio 10
            years ago. For the last 9 years I have served as Scoutmaster and
            Assistant Scoutmaster for my son’s Boy Scout troop. We spend most of
            our time exposing our kids to different activities and attending
            their track and XC meets.

          <li>
            <strong>Academic background: </strong>High School diploma, some
            college courses

            <strong>Background in this subject: </strong>I started learning how
            to code when I joined the “Fast Track” program at IBG solutions, a
            Charlotte based tech company. After a year in the program it seemed
            to become non-existent, so I continued to teach myself. Software is
            something that I watched change the world and has become very
            inmportant and incredibly useful in all of our lives. I would like
            to be a part of the force that continues to create software that
            will help people push their personal boudaries further by solving
            problems. I use and/or am familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
            Reactjs, Nextjs, React Native, Tailwind CSS, MUI, Git, Github,
            Bootstrap, MongoDB, SQL, and Firebase.
          </li>

          <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform: </strong>Mac OS</li>

              <li>
                <strong>CRO7000-01:</strong> <br />
                I’m taking this course to help me refine my skills and cover
                anything I have missed in past training. More importantly, being
                in the paid apprenticeship program after completing the training
                helps me get over the hurdle of entering this industry with no
                on-the-job experience.

            <strong>Funny/Interesting item about yourself: </strong>I’m left
            handed in sports, but I write and draw with my right hand. I cut my
            own hair. Can you tell?

            geckos.
