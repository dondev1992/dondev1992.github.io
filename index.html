          <h3>Software Engineering Infrastructure</h3>
          <dt>
            Describe the purpose of an Interactive Development Environment
            (IDE):
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The purpose of an IDE is to provide a environment to build and test
            code/applications/websites and provide tools to help make that
            process faster and smoother.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Describe two advantages of an Interactive Development Environment:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Two advantages of an IDE are auto-formatting and linting features
          </dd>
          <dt>Define the purpose of a Source control:</dt>
          <dd>
            The purpose of source control is to give you the ability to access
            previous versions of your code without having to manually try to
            change your code back to a previous state and lose your current
            state of code. It solves the complexity of multiple developers
            working on the same file being able to update individual changes
            successfully.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Describe two advantages of utilizing a source control system to
            develop software:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Two advantages of using a a source control system are to save all
            versions of your code and to be able to share and access that code
            from anywhere.

          <h3>Software Engineering Practice</h3>
          <dt>
            What three programming languages are required to generate a web
            page?
          </dt>
          <dd>HTML, CSS, Javascript</dd>
          <dt>
            What is the purpose of writing pseudocode in software engineering?
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Psuedocode is for writing out each step that is needed for your code
            to execute as planned. Then writing the necessary code in place of
            those steps.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Write pseudocode for a for loop that calculates the sum of all
            integers from 0 to 9:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <ol>
              <li>Change the data type to an array if needed.</li>
              <li>Declare a variable to store the sum of the integers.</li>
              <li>
                Create a loop that with iterate through each index of the array
                and take the value of each index and add it to the value of the
                "sum" variable.
              </li>
              <li>Return "sum" variable</li>
            </ol>
          </dd>
          <dt>Describe the purpose of a function in software engineering:</dt>
          <dd>
            A function is a piece of code/object that is made to perform a
            specific task when called/invoked.
          </dd>
          <dt>Describe the purpose of a library in software engineering:</dt>
          <dd>
            A library is a set of pre-written and already tested code that can
            be used for things that you would have to create yourself. This
            helps speed up the development process and reduces some redundant
            coding.
