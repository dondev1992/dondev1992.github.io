        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p>
          I, Donald C. Moore agree to abide by the terms of the course contract
          in my Fall Semester 2022, CRO7000-01, CO Programming course with my
          instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online
          tools will be available to the world, and will not put information
          there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep
          private.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
          logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in
          assignments may show as absences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I also understand that given the structure and content of this class
          it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’
          code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
          and will not cut and paste code except where I havei have properly
          given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
        </p>
